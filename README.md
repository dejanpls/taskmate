## Introduction

TaskMate is a simple to-do app built with vanilla JavaScript and Webpack, designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The app uses local storage to save tasks, and is structured using ES6 modules and classes to maintain clean and modular code.

The focus is on simplicity â€” allowing users to add, edit, delete, set due dates, categorize and mark tasks as completed.

As development progresses, TaskMate may evolve to include additional features and improved UI/UX. The goal is to avoid unnecessary complexity while keeping the codebase organized and scalable during my learning phase.
